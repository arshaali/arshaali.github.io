Ideas:<br>
-change the theme basic blue color: There is 1 line in "variable.scss" and 8 lines in "style.css" where you need to replace #007bff with your choosen color. This does not change the blue on the buttons (e.g., "See All", "PDF") or downward arrow.<br>
-add to news and featured news when you have something to say
-add to 2023 awards in about page as you earn them
