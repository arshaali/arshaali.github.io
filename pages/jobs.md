### Inteva Products

#### Latches Advanced Development Intern (May - Aug 2018)

After my second year of college, I interned at Inteva Products in the Closures product line department, focusing specifically on Latches Advanced Development. I designed, coded, and built an electrical controller to showcase auto reset, power release, and double pull override functionalities in a future-production rear car door electric latch. Auto reset is when the latch system resets after one cable pull, power release is when one pull electrically unlatches, and a double pull override is when two cable pulls unlatches the system. Next, I conducted tests to simulate manual pulling of a handle to monitor heat buildup and time to complete auto reset over thousands of cycles. Furthermore, I developed the electrical controls for cinching a vehicle door from secondary to primary position to ensure passenger safety. At the end of the summer, I had the opportunity to showcase my accomplishments to the company's executive leaders.

#### Motors and Electronics Intern (May - Aug 2017)

After my first year of college, I interned at Inteva Products for the Motors and Electronics product line department. While I was there, I designed a motor conformity matrix with Inteva's top customers to compare Inteva motor capabilities with customer requirements and identified numerous areas for improvement within the motor product line. I also preformed hall effect sensor tests to support a successful design validation test and allow for continuation with product validation testing. Aside from the technical aspects, I was able to understand the responsibilities of an engineer in a professional workplace. At the end of my term, I successfully completed an executive presentation showcasing my accomplishments over the summer.
