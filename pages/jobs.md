### U.S. Army Research Laboratory

#### Information Science/Humans in Complex Systems Research Intern (May - Aug 2024)

When I started in this role, I learned of a user experiment that had been conducted in 2023 where data was collected from many sources. My task was to propose a research topic to investigate using the collected data, code scripts to extract measures from the raw data, analyze the data through statistical tests, and write and submit a publication on the findings. To start, I read protocols and documents to understand the experiment and reviewed terabytes of data. I iterated on proposing an interesting research topic, until deciding and getting approval to investigate the impact of autonomy on user engagement, trust, and performance in solider platoon teams. The challenge was to find a topic that is narrow enough in scope to feasibly investigate but also broad enough to accurately capture the various unscripted nature and aspects of the experiment, along with avoiding analyzing data that other team members were already looking into. I coded scripts in Python to extract the measures I wanted to analyze, which requiring cross-referencing different files, aligning timestamps, and accounting for all permutations and edge cases. I learned about and performed linear regressions in SPSS and created plots on the results using MATLAB. During the summer, I also spent 3 weeks participating, observing, and assisting in another ongoing experiment that was being conducted. Towards the end of the internship, I presented a 3 minute thesis style presentation to my division and was advanced as a finalist to represent my division and present at the summer research symposium. After the internship concluded, I continued to write a research paper on the work I was investigating. I wrote a manuscript and upon feedback from my co-authors, I submitted this paper for peer-review and publication in a journal.

### Fiat Chrysler Automobiles

#### Software Engineer (Jun - Aug 2020)

In this role, I read documentation and vehicle functionality guidelines for requirements and specifications that needed to be met in future production vehicles. One of the features I worked on was the design and logic behind ambient lighting in a vehicle. For example, this included how vehicle interior lights should respond based on different vehicle door and trunk states, timing, and user input. After reading the specifications, I used model-based design techniques in Simulink to develop the logic. The design was tested with software-in-the-loop testing and iterated on for improvements.

### Inteva Products

#### Latches Advanced Development Intern (May - Aug 2018)

After my second year of college, I interned at Inteva Products in the Closures product line department, focusing specifically on Latches Advanced Development. I designed, coded, and built an electrical controller to showcase auto reset, power release, and double pull override functionalities in a future-production rear car door electric latch. Auto reset is when the latch system resets after one cable pull, power release is when one pull electrically unlatches, and a double pull override is when two cable pulls unlatches the system. Next, I conducted tests to simulate manual pulling of a handle to monitor heat buildup and time to complete auto reset over thousands of cycles. Furthermore, I developed the electrical controls for cinching a vehicle door from secondary to primary position to ensure passenger safety. At the end of the summer, I had the opportunity to showcase my accomplishments to the company's executive leaders.

#### Motors and Electronics Intern (May - Aug 2017)

After my first year of college, I interned at Inteva Products for the Motors and Electronics product line department. While I was there, I designed a motor conformity matrix with Inteva's top customers to compare Inteva motor capabilities with customer requirements and identified numerous areas for improvement within the motor product line. I also preformed hall effect sensor tests to support a successful design validation test and allow for continuation with product validation testing. Aside from the technical aspects, I was able to understand the responsibilities of an engineer in a professional workplace. At the end of my term, I successfully completed an executive presentation showcasing my accomplishments over the summer.

### Oakland University

#### Undergraduate Resarch Assistant

One of my responsibilities was to build dynamic projects to put in the 1st floor showcase in the Engineering Center. The projects were to activate by a hand wave, allowing visitors to interact with the projects. One of the projects I built was a delta robot with fine-tuned precision control to stack and unstack ping pong balls in a pyramid formation. I developed the code in Arduino to control movements of the servos, which act as the arms of the robot. A syringe tied to a tube created a suction effect to transport the ping pong balls. I assembled the delta robot initially from wood, and then 3D printed parts for improved accuracy. I implemented improvements, such as smoothening the movements between positions, to gain greater consistency of results.

Another project I built was â€‹a PID controller designed to stabilize a ball, move the ball in a circle, and move the ball in a rectangle on a flat plate. A pixy camera is used to detect the position of the colored ball, and this position is read by the Arduino Uno board. The code uses the error between the current position of the ball and the desired position along with the time between consecutive errors to control servos for the x and y axis attached to the plate. This system utilizes a proportional and a derivative constant. The constants were tuned to obtain the fastest response from the system. The stabilization of the ball was achieved by setting a desired position for the ball. The circular and rectangular movements were achieved by varying the desired position for the ball with time.
