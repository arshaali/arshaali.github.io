### Trust-Based Task Allocation Strategy for use in Heterogenous Human-Robot Teams

In heterogenous human-robot teams where agents are working towards a common goal, there is a need to allocate indivisible tasks to agents on the team. I am actively working on a novel task allocation strategy that is based on trust in the agent. 

### Driver Takeover Study in Highly Automated Vehicles

In highly automated vehicles, a driver is required to takeover control from the automated system and manually drive in the event of a situation automation cannot handle. Until autonomy is perfected, a driver’s input is mission critical. However, it is possible the driver became occupied with an alternate, non-driving related task and no longer has the proper situation awareness to safely takeover driving before automation is disengaged. The purpose of this study was to understand how common non-driving related tasks affect a driver’s takeover performance.

To study the effects of non-driving related tasks on takeover performance, important non-driving related tasks were determined through a questionnaire and a realistic driving simulator was constructed. This work is documented [here](http://libjournals.unca.edu/ncur/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3265-Ali-Arsha-FINAL.pdf).
